This research project focuses on creation of a new exploratory tool for metagenomic data analysis. The core component of this tool is a new algorithm to measure polymorphic mutational frequencies adjacent to fixed mutations, which works via an integrated Java pipeline employing several existing algorithms to process raw genomic mutational data through steps such as assembly, blast matching, re-mapping, binning, and re-assembly.
